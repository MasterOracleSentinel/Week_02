Task Instructions
In this activity, you will define a variable within a JavaScript function. You'll learn more about functions later. For now, we'll focus on variables.

To accomplish this task, you need to do the following:

In this activity you will be working in the variables-01/variables-01.js file.

Be sure to navigate to the coorisponding NextTech Web Browser tab. To do this, 
enter the following URL localhost:8080/variables-01 in the NextTech browser and press the enter key.

Create a variable called myFriend using one of the variable declarations described above (var, let, or const).
Set the variable you created to contain your friend's name.
Inside the greetings function, return the string: "Greetings [your-friend's-name]."
Note: The following line of code console.log('results: ', greetings()); will print the result of 

your code to the console. You will learn more about how this works later on in the course.

In this activity you will be working in the variables-02/variables-02.js file.

Be sure to navigate to the coorisponding NextTech Web Browser tab. To do this, enter the following 
URL localhost:8080/variables-02 in the NextTech browser and press the enter key.

Task Instruction
In this activity you will be working in the variables-03/variables-03.js file.

Be sure to navigate to the coorisponding NextTech Web Browser tab. To do this, enter the following URL localhost:8080/variables-03 in the 
NextTech browser and press the enter key.

In this activity, you will declare variables with let and const keywords. The function testBestFlavor needs to print the message: 
"Ana says, lacroix orange is a better flavor than lacroix grapefruit."

To make this function complete, you need to declare two constants:

lacroix1: This needs to be declared outside the scope of the function testBestFlavor using const and it needs to have the value "grapefruit".
lacroix2: This needs to be declared inside the scope of the function testBestFlavor using const and it needs to have the value "orange".
After you're done with your code changes, check the console to see if the printed message is correct. Then, submit the task.
